# e-Hospital Project

## About the Project

e-Hospital is a web platform developed using .NET 8 and Angular 17. It dynamically changes content based on user roles, allowing doctors and patients to view their appointments, while administrators can create appointments for patients by selecting doctors.  The system prioritizes security and user experience with features like JWT-based authentication, refresh token mechanisms, and email verification.

## Features

- **Dynamic Content Based on User Roles**: Viewing appointments for doctors, and creating appointments through doctor selection for admins.
- **Secure Authentication**: Utilization of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and refresh tokens.
- **Email Verification**:  Necessary when a user is created.
- **Forgot Password**: Users can reset their forgotten passwords via email.
- **Appointment Management**: Admins can assign appointments to patients by selecting doctors.
